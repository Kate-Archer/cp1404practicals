# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have stopped some old coding habits that were bad. I'm using the correct naming/writing convention 90% of the time. 

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to manage my time more consistently and avoid leaving practicals to the last minute.
I need to work on not talking over the teacher during explanations. I was doing that because I felt rushed and wanted to jump straight into the coding tasks since I know they take me a while to finish. 
I’m learning to slow down, listen fully first, and trust that understanding the explanation properly will actually save me time later.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve become better at predicting when an error is likely to occur and understanding why it happens. 
I can see potential issues in my code before running it, which helps me create exception handling faster

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop over-complicating my solutions. Sometimes I try to make the code too advanced for myself instead of keeping it simple and readable.
I need to improve my commits and comments too. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

More simple examples before touching on the advanced code.
