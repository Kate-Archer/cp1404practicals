# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I am up to date for now. 

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Afternoons after class or work, and over the weekend in my room. As for the time, I'll spend as long as it takes to get through the content with some short breaks.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm trying to follow the formatting style correctly and keep the indenting correct with ctrl + alt + L. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop overthinking or overcomplicating the task to the point where I don't answer what was actually asked for (a tangent).
I need to unlearn old, bad coding habbits. I need to unlearn old naming conventions and comment styles from other classes. 

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Reading or understanding the questions wrong.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Trying to follow the format correctly.
