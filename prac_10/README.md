## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I often took longer than I expected to complete a task, often by 20 minutes or longer for the more lengthy tasks. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I often forgot to write an estimate before starting the code as I did not know how long the code would actually take me
until after I completed it - sometimes it would take longer than I initially thought because I got stuck on a task.
I also forgot to accurately keep track of the time I took to complete the task or took a break part way when doing the
code. This caused the time estimates versus actual time to be inaccurate and somewhat meaningless.  

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I am a slow coder and my concept of how long a task will take is poor. I am hoping that as I do more tasks I will 
understand how long it should take me and get faster at completing a task. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

According to my peers my indents and docstrings are strong most of the time. However, I do easily overlook details in 
the code that make my code poorer. For example, in one of my pracs I made a class repr method but then completely 
forgot to use it and remade the print statement in another section. This made me realise the importance of 'DRY' code
which will make the coding process not only easier for me, but more easy to read for other users/reviewers. It also 
made me understand the importance of rereading through my code as there is always room for improvements - which is 
often easier to point out from the perspective of another person with fresh eyes.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

### Good Code Review 1
[Pull Request (Prac 05)](https://github.com/harleypool14/cp1404practicals_2025/pull/1#event-20541394332)

### Explanation
I used a friendly tone to reflect helpful comments without coming across as mean or blunt.
I pointed out areas that need improvement in their code such as the incorrect tone (must be imperative instead) 
but also highlighted areas that worked well to help them reflect on what areas they need to strengthen and which
areas they should continue to do well. 

### Good Code Review 2
[Pull Request (Prac 08)](https://github.com/EvanXie756/cp1404practicals/pull/5#issuecomment-3544718175)

### Explanation
I used the same friendly tone as before and simple emojis or a thumbs up to put the reviewee at ease.
I reminded them how to properly format the docstrings and comments as they had small details missing.
I also provided them with a tip that I myself use to remember to complete the docstrings which I believe the peer
may find helpful just like I have.
Finally, for each review I wrote a finally overall comment re-elaborating the strengths and errors of their code in a 
respectful manner - as I know my code also contains strengths and weaknesses as well. We are all learning together.


## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

For the practical containing the Project Management task was quite long as you acknowledged.
I feel its length was unbalanced and slightly unfaired compared to the other practicals and caused some students 
to skip the task all together due to lack of time available or poor time management.
This could be improved by making Project Management the only task for that practical and split it up into sub-tasks, or
shorten it a little. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I effectively completed tasks before the deadline by a solid 3 days or more.
