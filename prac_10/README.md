## Estimates (mins)
Prac 05 - Estimates:20, 20, 30 | Actual: 28, 18, 24
Prac 06 - Estimates:30, ?, 30 | Actual: 35, 84 (with breaks), 32
Prac 07 Project Management - Estimate: 2 hours, Actual: 8~ hours

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I often took longer than I expected to complete a task, often by 20 minutes or longer for the more lengthy tasks.
This was reflected in the project management task. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Throughout the subject, I struggled to create accurate time estimates. I often forgot to write my estimate before 
starting the code, mainly because I wasn’t confident about how long each task would actually take. Many tasks ended up 
taking longer than expected when I became stuck or needed more time to understand a concept. I also frequently forgot
to keep track of my actual working time or took breaks in between. Therefore, my estimated times and actual times
didn’t always match, making the comparisons less meaningful than they could have been.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that my sense of how long coding tasks will take is still developing, and I tend to underestimate the
required time. I realised that I work more slowly than I expected, especially when problem-solving or learning new 
concepts. However, completing multiple tasks has helped me improve my awareness of my own pace, and I believe that
with more practice my estimates will become more accurate and my coding speed will improve overtime.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

According to my peers my indents and docstrings are strong most of the time. However, I do easily overlook small details
in the code that make my code poorer. For example, in one of my pracs I made a class repr method but then completely 
forgot to use it and remade the print statement in another section. This made me realise the importance of 'DRY' code
which will make the coding process not only easier for me (as I will have less code to write), but more easy to read
for other users/reviewers. It also made me understand the importance of rereading through my code as there is always
room for improvements - which is often easier to point out from the perspective of another person with fresh eyes.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

### Good Code Review 1
[Pull Request (Prac 05)](https://github.com/harleypool14/cp1404practicals_2025/pull/1#event-20541394332)

### Explanation

I used a friendly and supportive tone to provide helpful comments without sounding blunt or critical. I identified
areas that needed improvement in their code, such as correcting their tone to be imperative, but I also highlighted the
parts they implemented well. My goal was to help them clearly see both the skills they should continue to build on and 
the areas that would benefit from further development.

### Good Code Review 2
[Pull Request (Prac 08)](https://github.com/EvanXie756/cp1404practicals/pull/5#issuecomment-3544718175)

### Explanation

I used the same friendly tone as before and included simple emojis, such as a thumbs-up, to help put the reviewee at 
ease. I reminded them about proper docstring and comment formatting, pointing out a few small details they had missed.
I also shared a tip that I personally use to remember to complete docstrings, which I believe may be helpful for them 
as well.
Finally, for each review I wrote an overall summary that highlighted both the strengths and the areas for improvement
in their code, keeping the feedback respectful and constructive. I approached the review with the mindset that my own
code also has strengths and weaknesses - we’re all learning together.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

For the practical that included the Project Management task, I found the workload noticeably larger compared to other
practicals. The length and depth of the task felt unbalanced, and many students struggled to complete it on time, 
often because of limited time during the week (between classes) or weaker time-management skills.
This could be improved by making Project Management the sole focus of that practical and breaking it into smaller,
guided sub-tasks, or by reducing the overall length of the activity. Either approach would help ensure students can
complete it meaningfully without feeling overwhelmed or rushing.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I effectively completed tasks before the deadline by a solid 3 days or more.
